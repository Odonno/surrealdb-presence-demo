## Tech stack

This is a list of the most important technologies used in this project:

- React + TypeScript (Vite template)
- TanStack Query
- jotai (jotai-forms)
- SurrealDB
- surrealdb-migrations

## Features

- Authentication
  - Sign up
  - Sign in
  - Sign out
  - Display authenticated user details such as realtime presence
- List of rooms with number of active users
  - List of joined rooms vs. other rooms
  - Join a room
- Joined rooms
  - Display the list of users in rooms
  - Show presence of each user
  - Send message
  - Show realtime messages (when a user entered or left a room, when a new message is sent)
  - Leave the room

Current configuration:

- Signal user presence in room periodically (every 10 seconds)
- Display presence status:
  - **green** - < 2min of inactivity
  - **yellow** - < 10min of inactivity
  - **gray** - > 10min of inactivity

## Get started

1. Start a new SurrealDB instance locally

```bash
surreal start --log debug --user root --pass root memory --auth --allow-guests
```

2. Apply migrations

```bash
surrealdb-migrations apply
```

3. Install dependencies and run the web app

```bash
bun install
bun start
```

4. Launch your web browser on the generated url (eg. http://localhost:5173/) and play with the app (create new accounts, join rooms, leave rooms)

And voil√†!
